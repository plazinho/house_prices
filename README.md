# Data analysis and implementation of ML models
- Data set - [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Models training: Lasso, Ridge, XGboost, LGBM
- Hyperparameters tuning with a a help of GridSearch
- Feature analysis with a 'Feature importances' and 'Permutation importances'
- Clustering
- Best result was achieved with a Lasso model: __546th__ place out of __4416__ with a RMSLE metric __0.12316__
